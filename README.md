Mobile Sales Data Dashboard

1. Project Title / Headline
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard for comprehensive analysis of mobile sales data. This tool is designed to provide key business insights, track performance, and uncover trends in the mobile retail sector.

2. Short Description / Purpose
This project is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report that transforms raw mobile sales data into actionable business intelligence. The dashboard helps stakeholders, such as sales managers and business analysts, to easily understand sales performance, monitor key metrics, and make data-driven decisions.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

Power BI Desktop: The main data visualization platform used for report creation.

Power Query: Used for data transformation and cleaning to reshape and prepare the data for analysis.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for creating calculated measures (e.g., total sales, average price), dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

Data Modeling: Established relationships between tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregation across different data points.

File Format: The project includes the .pbix file for development and a .png for a dashboard preview.

4. Data Source
(Assuming a hypothetical source for a realistic README)

The data for this dashboard is a fictional dataset representing mobile sales transactions. It includes details such as:

Sales figures and quantities

Transaction dates

Payment methods (UPI, Credit Card, etc.)

Product information (brand and mobile model)

Geographical data (city)

Customer ratings

5. Features / Highlights
Business Problem: A key challenge in retail is quickly analyzing vast amounts of sales data to identify trends and performance drivers. Raw data is often difficult to interpret, making it hard for decision-makers to react to market changes.

Goal of the Dashboard: To deliver an interactive and intuitive visual tool that:

Enables users to explore sales performance by various filters (Brand, Day, Month, City).

Uncovers key trends in sales quantity and value over time.

Highlights the performance of specific mobile brands and models.

Provides insights into customer behavior via payment method and rating analysis.

Key Visuals & Insights: The dashboard provides a comprehensive view through several key visuals:

KPIs: At-a-glance metrics for Total Sales, Total Quantity, Transactions, and Average Sale Value.

Geographical Analysis: A map visual that pinpoints sales distribution across different cities.

Trend Analysis: Line charts for sales quantity by month and bar charts for sales by day of the week.

Performance Breakdown: Charts and tables showing sales performance by brand, mobile model, and payment method.
